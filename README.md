# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

## Description

My motivation for this project was to refactor the code to make it easier for anybody to read the code. I built this project, because, when there are so many div tags its hard to distinguish what is going on in the code. For anybody wanting to learn from the code, this project makes it easier for people to read the code by seperating tags and classes and naming them properly. I learned that refacting is tedious work and instead of having to refactor in the future, one should use semantic html from the beginning.
